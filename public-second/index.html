              <p data-aos="fade-right"data-aos-duration="3000">Creativity depends on we perceive the things everyone has their own perception.It's not only that how deep we get into the physical appearance it's about how deep we get into the soul of the things then we would be able to give them meanings.World has different colours but question is that have we seen all? Thus, see the world from different angle so that we can enjoy and taste the different colours of life. never see the things from same angles if u want different colours in your life.Creativity is not just the use of your imagination, it is the use of your imagination followed by the act of creation. Having great ideas and thoughts is not enough to be creative, without producing, great ideas and thoughts alone would be just being imaginative. </p>
              <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="3000">Creative people are able to look at things and situations in novel ways and from different angles and perspectives. Tests for creativity often measure the number of, and how unique the answers are, that a creative person can think of.</p>

                I have spent my professional career developing. I work every day to better my understanding in both the technical side of my profession, as well as the cultural side. In my opinion, both are as equally important.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="3000">Imagination is considered "a power of the mind," "a creative faculty of the mind," "the mind" itself when in use, and a "process" of the mind used for thinking, scheming, contriving, remembering, creating, fantasizing, and forming opinion.Imagination is the part of viewing the things you could not believe the power of imagination that we can visit so many things by our imagination even thought we are not there in reality but with imagination we can connect with so many things...</p>
             <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="3000">The real key to turning imagination into reality is acting as if the imagined scene were real and already accomplished. Instead of pretending it is a scene from the future, imagine it as though you are truly experiencing it in the present. It is a real event in the now. The great masters of antiquity have told use through the ages that whatever you believe you become. If you believe and imagine in the now that you are whatever you wish to be then reality must conform.</p>
